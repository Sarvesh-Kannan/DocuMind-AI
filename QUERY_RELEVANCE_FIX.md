# 🎯 Query Relevance Fix - Making AI Responses More Specific

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

Based on the user's screenshot, the AI was not providing sufficiently relevant answers to specific queries. For example:
- **Query**: "Applications of Sinkhorn"
- **Issue**: AI response talked about general Sinkhorn algorithms and transport optimization instead of focusing specifically on **applications**

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering** (`phase3_local_llm.py`)

**Before (Generic Prompt):**
```
You are a helpful AI assistant that answers questions based on provided documents. 
Question: {query}
Instructions:
- Answer the question directly and accurately based ONLY on the information in the provided documents
- ...
Answer:
```

**After (Query-Focused Prompt):**
```
You are a helpful AI assistant that answers specific questions based on provided documents.
QUESTION: {query}
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer ONLY the specific question being asked - "{query}"
- Focus your entire response on addressing this exact question
- Use ONLY information from the provided documents below
- ...
RESPONSE (Answer the question "{query}" specifically):
```

### **2. Improved Response Cleaning**

**Enhanced the response cleaning to preserve content that directly answers the query:**
- Reduced aggressive filtering of meaningful content
- Only removes obvious "thinking" patterns at the beginning
- Preserves actual answers even if they mention the question

### **3. Key Changes Made**

1. **Emphasized Query Focus**: Added repeated emphasis on answering the specific question asked
2. **Clearer Instructions**: Made it explicit that the AI should focus on the exact question
3. **Better Formatting**: Used uppercase headers to make instructions more prominent
4. **Query Repetition**: Repeated the query in multiple places to reinforce focus

## 📊 **Test Results**

After applying the fix, testing shows **100% success rate** for query relevance:

```
🎯 Query Relevance Test Results
✅ Relevant responses: 3/3
📊 Success rate: 100%
🎉 All responses appear to be query-focused!
```

### **Specific Test Cases:**
1. ✅ **"Applications of Sinkhorn"** → Now focuses on uses and applications
2. ✅ **"What is Sinkhorn?"** → Now focuses on definition and explanation  
3. ✅ **"How does Sinkhorn work?"** → Now focuses on methodology and process

## 🎯 **Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- Responses were often generic and covered broad topics
- AI would provide general information about the subject
- Users got relevant but not specifically targeted answers

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Responses directly address the specific question asked
- ✅ AI focuses precisely on what the user wants to know
- ✅ Answers are more targeted and useful
- ✅ Better user experience with more relevant information

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

**Files Modified:**
- `phase3_local_llm.py` - Enhanced `_generate_prompt()` method
- `phase3_local_llm.py` - Improved `_clean_response()` method

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Query Emphasis**: The exact query is repeated 3 times in the prompt
2. **Specific Instructions**: Clear directive to answer only the specific question
3. **Better Context**: Documents are labeled as "RELEVANT DOCUMENTS"
4. **Response Guidance**: Final prompt line reinforces the specific question

## 🎊 **Result**

**The system now provides much more relevant and targeted responses that directly answer the specific question being asked, solving the original issue where responses were too general or off-topic.**

Users will now get:
- ✅ Precise answers to their specific questions
- ✅ Focused responses that don't drift into general topics  
- ✅ Better satisfaction with AI-generated summaries
- ✅ More useful and actionable information
